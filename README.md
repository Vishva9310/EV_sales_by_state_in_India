# Electric Vehicle Sales by State in India – A Data Analytics Project 📊
##Project Overview:
 I recently completed a data analytics project analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales across Indian states from 2015 to 2024 using Python. This project involved data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to identify key trends in EV adoption.
# Tools & Technologies Used:
 ✅ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
 ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
 ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Data Insights & Key Findings:
 📈EV Sales Growth: Rapid increase in adoption since 2019, fueled by government incentives & consumer awareness.
 🏆 Top States in EV Adoption: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu lead in EV registrations.
 🏍️ Market Trends: Two-wheelers dominate the EV market, while four-wheelers and commercial EVs are growing steadily.
 ⚠️ Regional Disparities: States with weak infrastructure and policy support lag in adoption.
# Visualizations & Analysis:
 🔹 Yearly EV sales trends
 🔹 State-wise EV sales distribution
 🔹 EV category-wise sales (2W, 3W, 4W, Buses)
 🔹 Bar charts, pie charts, and time series analysis
# Technical Steps:
 ✔️ Data imported from a CSV file and preprocessed
 ✔️ Missing values handled using forward-fill methods
 ✔️ Duplicates removed & data types standardized
 ✔️ Visualized key insights using Python
# Conclusion:
 The project highlights India's accelerating EV adoption, showing regional disparities and market trends that can help policymakers and businesses make data-driven decisions.
